I am a graduate student at Northeastern University, Boston, MA pursuing my Masters in Data Analytics. I have started my course from September 2021. Currently studying Statistics, R programming, Python Programming, Analytical methods to study the data.
I also have prior work experience of 4.5 years with IBM India as an ETL Data Engineer. I have worked over data migration projects using Informatica Powercenter and Informatica Cloud tools.
Other than work and studies, I am a fun loving person who loves to roam around and likes to communicate with people. Also, I love cooking and exploring variety of food.
